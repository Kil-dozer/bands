        extended hiatus in early 2010 due to Burnley's recurring illnesses.

        musician and producer based in Oltedal, Norway. A multi-instrumentalist,
        he is known for his metal covers of popular songs, which have gained him
        over 3.5 million followers on YouTube as frogleapstudios. He has
        recorded over 308 covers, at a rate of approximately one per week,
        including covers of "Hello" by Adele, "Sail" by AWOLNATION, "Poker Face"
        and "Bad Romance" by Lady Gaga, "Feel Good Inc." by Gorillaz,

        by Luis Fonsi peaked at number 35 on the Hungarian Single Top 40 chart
        on 10 August 2017. For each video, Moracchioli creates the arrangements,
        and plays all the instruments, except for a small number of songs in
        which he has collaborated with other instrumentalists; they often
        require at least 50 tracks. Moracchioli states that although he is
        playing covers, it is enough of a creative outlet for him to put his own
        spin on the songs.

        irreverent lyrical toilet humor. Bassist Mark Hoppus is the only
        constant band member.
