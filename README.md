# Bands

For tonight, I want you to show off what you favorite music is. You will be creating a multiple page app, using react-router.

Objectives
Create a SPA, with a few pages
Deploying your website
Requirements:

Build a website that has 4 pages.
1 landing
a page for your top three favorite bands (each).

Explorer Mode
Add react-router-dom to your project.
Create a Landing page that displays a short description of all three of your bands
Build 3 band pages. These pages should have a
a band picture
band name
Latest Album information
Each page should have a nav bar that allows the user to browse from page to page
Deploy your site
TIP: for Explorer mode focus on getting the router set up and linking up the pages to each other.

Adventure Mode
Instead of hard coding the URL, try to use parameters, components and JSON file to supply navigation for your site.
Career support (resume) and capstone come to mind.
